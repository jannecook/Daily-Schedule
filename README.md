# Daily Schedule

## Description

This project was designed to provide a simple daily calendar to help a working professional map out the tasks and meetings in their day to help them stay on top of their schedule. It leverages the Day.js library to implement date and time functionality. I learned 
about implementing a third party API into a software application while working on this project.
